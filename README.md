# stock_time_series_analysis

This is a project 3 classmates and I worked on for our regression and time series analysis course as a part of our Masters program. 

We were tasked with finding an interesting dataset to preform time series forecasting on. We decided to analyze stock data.

Please read the project report for an in depth explanation of our project.
